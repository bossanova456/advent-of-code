To start a new year, copy/paste a previous year folder and update the year in `template/index.js`

To start a new day, enter the directory for the year and run `./new-day.sh <day number>`

Each problem has it's own directory. A .env file will be needed for each, containing `session=<sessionId>`. Session ID can be retrieved from adventofcode.com cookies once logged in (do not commit this)
